What is an ISO File?
ISO is a disc image file. (The file is no good unless it can be opened, assembled and used.) Often used to distribute large programs over the internet. These files are typically easy to download and easy to burn to a disc or other device. This contains an exact copy of an optical disc. 
How do you write an ISO file to a CD, DVD, or removable media (like a thumb drive)?
You can extract ISO files and burn the full image to a device
How do you create an ISO file?
Several programs allow you to do this. You can install and use programs that allow you to create an ISO file and many of these programs are free. 
How do you mount an ISO file?
Trick your computer into thinking the ISO file is a real disk. 
Mounting an ISO file is usually as simple as opening the file with something called a “disc emulator” and then choosing a drive letter that the ISO file should represent.




##Things I want to know more about:
